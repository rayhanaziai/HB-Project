# Easy Pay

Easy Pay is a full-stack web-application that holds money on behalf of transacting parties who have met over the internet. 

Its mission is to help consumers avoid scammers who ask for payment before the consumer has had the chance to verify the product. Both consumer and seller can view and agree to a contract which will determine the date and amount of payment to the seller providing he/she adheres to the terms outlined. Once agreed, the consumer will then send the money to Easy Pay, who will hold the funds until payment day when it will be automatically sent to the seller (providing the terms of the contract have not been broken).
